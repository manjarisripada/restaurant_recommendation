# Restaurant Recommendation System with Zomato Dataset

## Overview
This repository contains a Python-based restaurant recommendation system built using data from Zomato. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and basic recommendation techniques, providing insights into restaurant characteristics that users might find appealing.

## Features
Data Cleaning: Handles missing values, removes duplicates, and adjusts column formats.
Feature Engineering: Prepares columns by renaming, encoding, and transforming data for model compatibility.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations using correlation matrices and other plots to explore relationships among features.
Recommendation Model: Leverages text-based and numeric features to recommend restaurants.
Dataset
The dataset zomato.csv includes details about restaurants, such as ratings, costs, locations, and more.

## Requirements
Python libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, nltk
Install the required packages using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Preprocessing: Run cells to clean and prepare data.
Exploratory Analysis: Visualize correlations and feature distributions.
Recommendation: Implement or modify the recommendation system as desired.
Visualizations
Various visualizations, such as correlation heatmaps and count plots, provide insights into restaurant characteristics and user preferences.
